## RoboCup Simulation (Secondary/Open)

This page gives some install, set up and introduction to use Webots for a Rescue based simulation setup. 

### About

This rescue scenario based simulation competition will use [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/). Webots is an open-source robot simulator. It is widely used in industry, education and research. The Webots project started in 1996, initially developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland.  The simulator uses the physics engine ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) for detecting of collisions and simulating rigid body dynamics. The ODE library allows one to accurately simulate physical properties of objects such as velocity, inertia and friction.  It is used widely in both research and teaching, examples of useage can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/cyberboticswebots).

Controllers for robots can be developed in a variety of different lanugages including C, Python and MatLab.  Although Python will be used in these tuotorials, teams are welcome to use any of the alternative languages which are provided.
